# Data 
The example data in this repository is based on the Formal Alliance data set (v4.1) from: **Gibler, Douglas M. 2009. International military alliances, 1648-2008. CQ Press.  **. The original data can be found [here](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/formal-alliances)

The nodes represent countries, and the edges between countries denote the number of formal alliances that the two countries currently take place in together.

Note that this data is not used in the article.
